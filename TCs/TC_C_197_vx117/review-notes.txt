test/transcript.txt shows SOME usage but not all

test/run shows some goods/bads.  QUERY_STRING is the source taint, so
you set it to different values for each good/bad.  testOutput/
contains 1 bad and 1 good output.

This is called "CGI" but this executes as a local program, so there's
no client or server.

A "real" CGI *should* dump only to stdout, but lower.c apparently
dumps to a file called output.  That's the file referenced in
test/run.

Technical Impact is read application data.
