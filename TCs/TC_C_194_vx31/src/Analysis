input: 
filename=2.java&length=90

trapped messages:
countlines.c:317:59: runtime error: unsigned subtraction overflow [ expr = '-', lval = (uint32) 90, rval = (uint32) 99 ]

codes:

1. remaining_chars = ( unsigned int ) (max_line_length.u - place); , the input data 90 is assigned to max_line_length, and as there is a line whose length is longer than 90, thus, it will goes to above code.
2. as remaining_chars in this situation is larger than zero, then output_data_index will be 0
if ( remaining_chars > 0 )   //STONESOUP:TRIGGER_POINT       
      {
        output_data_index = 0;
      }

3.  printf("<html><body>%s %d</body></html>\n",config_data[output_data_index], lines_of_code);
it will printout config_data[0], which is a secret string

solution:
Do not convert the signed integer to the unsigned one
