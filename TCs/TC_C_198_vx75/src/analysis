code:

reason:
When running at untrusted mode, even root should not be given the privileged permission. However in the bad case, root is given the privileged permission under untrusted mode.

It's not caused by the user's input, instead by the codes itself.


In the bad case, the program runs in untrusted mode, it will not allow "root" as input(if it detects "root", it will stop running the followng code), the program call "is_root" before convert the string to proper encoding style,and "is_root" check only works for little-endian, the input file uses big-endian, thus the program will assume that it is not "root", and in the following code, it converted the UTF-32BE to UTF-8, it assumes that the previous code has already checked the username, thus it will give a "privileged operation" to the user.

The reason caused this error is that the program check the content of the file before converted it into proper encoding.

solution: 
check the content after conversion:
after executing:
if (wbuf[0] == 0xfffe0000u)
    cd = iconv_open ("UTF-8", "UTF-32BE");
  else if (wbuf[0] == 0x0000feffu)
    cd = iconv_open ("UTF-8", "UTF-32LE");
  else
    cd = iconv_open ("UTF-8", "UTF-32");


then execute:
strcmp (username, "root")

and if they are the same, stop processing this request.
