countlines.c:73:40: runtime error: value lost in conversion of '-1' from 'int' (int) to 'unsigned char' (unsigned char)

code:
int good = (int ) ( ( unsigned char ) checkargs( argc, argv ) );
checkargs return type of int(-1), and this value becomes a relatively large one
 when converted to type unsigned char, thus good is a relatively large number.

silly_array = calloc ( nsquaredplusone ( good ), sizeof ( int ) );
silly_array's length is larger than 100.(good*good+1)

when it comes to the following codes:
  if ( j > 100 )
              {
                while ( 0 == 0 )
                  {
                    j++;
                    j--;
                  }
              }
The larger length will make it run forever.

solution:
check the silly_array_length first and determine whether it is larger than 100
