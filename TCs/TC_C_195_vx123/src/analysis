cmdInterpreter.c:230:10: runtime error: value lost in conversion of '-10' from 'int' (int) to 'unsigned int' (unsigned int)
Illegal instruction (core dumped)

code:
end = getInteger(argv[holder + 2]);
getInteger returns type int while end is of type unsigned int, which makes end a very large number
copyRegs(registers, start, end, otfil) will call
copyReg(registers, i, end, otfil) 

copyReg(registers, i, end, otfil) will call copyRegs(registers, ++i, end, otfil) recursively until i>end.

However, end is very large, it will cause stack overflow



solution:
limit end to a relatively small number, and judge whether it exceeds the upbound first.
