Review Notes
------------

COPROCESS: no

ENV VARS: no

TECHNICAL IMPACT: DoS (CPU / file consumption)

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

  - this TC needs some work to become VALID; it can generate massive
    output.  rlimits or something similar should probably be enforced.
    Or, could redirect the output to /dev/null.  Or, could choose a
    very negative number.

  - For early testing, set TIMEOUT to 3 to limit scope of file dump


IO Pairs
