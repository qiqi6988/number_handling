Review Notes
------------


COPROCESS: yes ("./oneshotclt")

PORT: 8989

ENV VARS: no

TECHNICAL IMPACT: DoS (memory consumption)

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

  - the technical impact might vary depending on memory availability.
    If there's insufficient memory, then calloc will fail; if there's
    enough, then the program will consume lots of memory and probably
    time out while doing a very large computation.

[*** NOTE: depending on available memory, the giant calloc() in
./TC_C_195_vx72 might succeed, in which case the program will
timeout. ***]
