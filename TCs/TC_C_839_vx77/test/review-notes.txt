Review notes
------------


COPROCESS: yes (jclient2 - CUSTOM - DIFFERENT than the one in the
           ssth/coprocess directory)

PORT: 9083

ENV VARS: no

TECHNICAL IMPACT: DoS (disk consumption)

DERIVED FROM: TC_C_839_base2

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

  - the server dumps to an output file using the "-o" option


Background
----------

This sets up a server that listens on port 9083.  It extracts the
first second of data from a .wav file that it receives over a socket.
The server is called with a "-o outputFile" option that dumps output
to a file.

Co-process is called "jclient2" - it's a MODIFICATION of the other
jclient.  Might be specific to this particular TC.

jclient2 argument is the input .wav file.  1 good and 1 bad file are
in testData/

jclient2 sends a large amount of .wav data over the socket to the
server, which then extracts the first second of data and dumps its
output to the file named in the "-o" option.
