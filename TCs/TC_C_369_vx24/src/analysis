The error caused by the following code:

unsigned long precision_needed(unsigned long* dx, unsigned long* dy){
  lldiv_t d = lldiv(*dy,
                *dx); // STONESOUP:TRIGGER_POINT
  if ( d.rem == 0 ){
    return 0;
  }else{
    return 1;
  }
}

when give the function lldiv(from stdlib.h) with a denomitor zero, it will cause the Floating point error, however, IOC cannot detect it because it will not check the library function.
