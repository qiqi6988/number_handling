error code:
recaman.c:214:30: runtime error: signed subtraction overflow [ expr = 'unary --', lval = (sint8) -128, rval = (sint8) 1 ]
make: *** [ioc_run_bad1] Illegal instruction (core dumped)


reason:
in the following code, as our bad input is 129, then j will decreased by 1 until it less than -129, however, j's least value is -128, then it will cause j becomes positive(127), and the index of array seq becomes negative(-127), which cause segment fault.
char j;

  for (j=0; j > -(size->n); j--) {      //STONESOUP:CROSSOVER_POINT     
    if (seq[-j] == value) {     //STONESOUP:TRIGGER_POINT       
      return 1;
    }
  }
