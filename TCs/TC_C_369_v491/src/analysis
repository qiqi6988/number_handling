use multiplication to do division in the following while loop, but A=6,B=0,A will never equal to B*C,while loop run infinitely. clang or ioc can't detect it because the B never appear as denominator

 case DIV:
        B = dataMemory[programMemory[PC][1]];
        sigA = signum( A );
        sigB = signum( B );
        A = sigA * A;
        B = sigB * B;
//      printf("%d%d",A,B);exit(1);
        C = 0;
        while ( A != B*C )      //STONESOUP:CROSSOVER_POINT     //STONESOUP:TRIGGER_POINT
          {
//      printf("ok");
            C++;
          }

solution:
add the following before the while loop:
if(B==0)
{printf("denominator could not be 0"); exit(0);}
