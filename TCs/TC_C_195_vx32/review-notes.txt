Review Notes
------------


ENV VAR: yes (QUERY_STRING)

COPROCESS: no

TECHNICAL IMPACT: segmentation fault / read application data

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

  - the original functionality of this TC has been severely reduced;
    it only accepts a single command ("cmd" parameter)

  - this is CGI which takes inputs from the QUERY_STRING variable



IO Pairs
--------


GOODs: see test/transcript.txt.

Good1: Dumps output to cmdout1 (see testOutput/)

Good2: Dumps to cmdout3 (see testOutput/)

Bad: segmentation fault; dumps UNPREDICTABLE contents to cmdout2
