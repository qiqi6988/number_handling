<val>file: The veteran backup, who signed a one-year, $1.25 million contract last Friday to be the No. 2 quarterback, has asked to be traded or released, a league source confirmed to ESPN Insider Adam Schefter.&#13;
&#13;
Stanton is said to be unhappy because he was promised the No. 2 job and turned down more lucrative opportunities with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs to play for the Jets. He received a $500,000 signing bonus, but he could have a hard time finding a new team because the backup jobs are filling up.&#13;
&#13;
General manager Mike Tannenbaum confirmed earlier this week that Stanton was to be Mark Sanchez's primary backup, but the Jets changed the plan when they acquired Tebow late Wednesday night in a trade with the Denver Broncos.&#13;
&#13;
"Tim is our backup quarterback. Mark is our starter," Tannenbaum said Thursday morning on ESPN Radio's "Mike and Mike in the Morning."&#13;
&#13;
Tebow was traded to the Jets on Wednesday night over an offer from the Jacksonville Jaguars after the Jets agreed to pay $2.53 million of a $5 million salary advance due Tebow, league sources told Schefter, after the question of who would pay that advance nearly unraveled the trade and gave Jacksonville one last shot at bringing the ex-Florida Gators hero back home.&#13;
&#13;
Jacksonville offered the Broncos $3 million toward Tebow's salary advance and a fourth-round draft pick, league sources told Schefter. That pick, based on the draft "value chart" that teams use to determine how to use their picks, is more valuable than the picks the Jets offered, sources said.&#13;
&#13;
The Jets traded their fourth- and sixth-round picks to Denver in exchange for Tebow and the Broncos' seventh-round selection.&#13;
&#13;
The Jets will pay the Broncos $1.5 million in 2012 and $1.03 million in 2013, a league source told ESPN sports business analyst Andrew Brandt. The payments will be made in 1/17th weekly installments.&#13;
&#13;
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the trade of Tebow to the Jets is the first time in NFL history that quarterback in his first or second year started and won a game in the playoffs and then changed teams that offseason. Tebow led the Broncos to a victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers in the wild-card round of the 2011 postseason.&#13;
&#13;
Tannenbaum said Thursday that he has talked to Stanton and his agent.&#13;
