error: In the following codes, it doesn't check whether the count is negative. If count is negative(in bad case, -1), then it will run until it wrap around. IOC may dectect it when it wrap around, but it will be too late.


 while (count-- > 0) {
#endif
                char *s;
                s = fgets(line, sizeof(line), file);
                /* Defect part 2: if we comment out this if, then the program will
                 * print the last line of the file over and over until it wraps
                 * around to zero.
                 */
//              if (s)
                        printf("%s", line); //STONESOUP:TRIGGER_POINT
        }


solution:
if(count<0)
{exit();}

while (count-- > 0) {
#endif
                char *s;
                s = fgets(line, sizeof(line), file);
                /* Defect part 2: if we comment out this if, then the program will
                 * print the last line of the file over and over until it wraps
                 * around to zero.
                 */
//              if (s)
                        printf("%s", line); //STONESOUP:TRIGGER_POINT
        }
