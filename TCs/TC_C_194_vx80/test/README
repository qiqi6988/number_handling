This is a client / server model shared memory program. Both the client
and server code are unique to this variant. This is based off of

TC_C_194_v527

The inputs / outputs are essentially the same as v527 except that we
use keys for shared memory now and the filename + length come in from
the client instead of at the command line to a standalone program.


Input files can be found in the testData directory.

NOTE: The technical impact is READ MEMORY. However, I'm not sure tools
can figure this out. However, they should be able to pick up on the
sign extension leading to an erroneous comparison, so I think it's
fine. Someone with better STONESOUP understanding should verify this.
