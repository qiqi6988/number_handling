Review Notes
------------


COPROCESS: yes (but not socket-based)

PORT: not applicable (uses shared memory)

ENV VARS: none

TECHNICAL IMPACT: read memory

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:

  - the source taint is shared memory, and a "lockfile" is used
    between "client" and "server" to coordinate writes to shared
    memory



IO Pairs
--------

See src/README - there are 2 goods and 2 bads
