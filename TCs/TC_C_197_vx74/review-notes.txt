Review Notes
------------

WARNING: this would hopefully be easy for getting into Eclipse but
might need some changes to become VALID.  See below.

See test/transcript.txt:

  - The LOWER_TEXT and UPPER_TEXT are environment variable settings

  - the use of "strings" on output3 is not required; you just compare
    output3 to the expected output file.

Technical Impact: read application data


Possible issues with VALID
--------------------------

output3 MUST be treated as binary, not text.

For the bad (output3 file), this TC reads out-of-bounds memory in a
cool way, but memory contents might be unpredictable.  Jay Carlson and
John did some tricks to try and guarantee that the memory always
contains NULLs.  In the source code, the keep[] variable is wrapped
between count[] and tbl[] which seem to contain only NUL bytes on my
Red Hat box; if this is consistent across env's then the output3 file
would be consistent.
