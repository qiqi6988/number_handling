195_vx72: I checked the INT_MAX and LONG_MAX on my laptop, and turns out that they are the same, both 32 bits.

For solution, we could choose many places to add check. where is the best?

can't run jclient2.exe for 196_vx73

no outputdata for 196_vx73


190_v295:which solution to choose?


190_v499:
source file has some errors, gcc can build it while ioc can't.

197_base2:
seems something wrong with the io-specification(base2 or base1?)
even good ones don't match for the output files

197_v445:
can't use flag -fioc-signed when build with ioc, or will cause error
bad2 have different results
